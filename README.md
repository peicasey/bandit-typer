An app to help users with a limited range of motion get the best typing experience! Takes in user input of sampled typing range and commonly used characters to find the optimal layout. Currently supports English only.

Final project for Texas A&M's Human-Computer Interaction course (CSCE 432) by Group 2. 

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

If this is the first time you have cloned the repo, run:
```bash
npm i
```

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.
